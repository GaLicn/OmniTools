## Overview

OmniTools is a small utility mod built around an **“omni‑tool ecosystem”**:  
instead of dozens of one‑off items, the goal is to provide a **few highly reusable tools** that cover a wide range of interactions.

In the current version, one of the main modules is the **Omni Wrench**,  
but the long‑term vision is **not limited to a single wrench** – new omni‑style tools and modules may be added as the project grows.

The mod is **under active development**:  
what you see now is only the starting point, and features are expected to evolve.

## Current Wrench / Special‑Tool Integrations (growing list)

Right now, the **Omni Wrench module** integrates core wrench‑like or special‑tool behavior from:

- **Create**
- **Mekanism**
- **Applied Energistics 2** (including Quartz Cutting Knife–style interactions)
- **Entangled**
- **Immersive Engineering**
- **Powah**
- **me_beam_former**

For many blocks from these mods that used to **require their own wrench or dedicated tool**,  
you can now **use the Omni Wrench instead**, greatly reducing tool‑swapping in your hotbar.

> This list will continue to change and expand in future releases –  
> it describes the *current* direction, not a final, frozen feature set.

## Future Direction & Feedback

Future development will stay focused on the **omni‑tool concept as a whole**:

- deepening the **Omni Wrench** module with more modes and smarter behaviors
- adding or expanding other omni‑style tools / modules for different use cases
- broad, consistent integration with popular tech / machinery / logistics mods

If you notice a mod, block, or tool workflow that **isn’t well supported yet**,  
please open an **issue on my GitHub** and include:

- which mod / block / tool you’re using
- what you expect the omni‑tool (especially the Omni Wrench and related modules) to do

I’ll do my best to **add support quickly** in upcoming versions,  
and your feedback will directly shape the roadmap of OmniTools.
